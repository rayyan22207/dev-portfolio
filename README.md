# Rayyan Aqil – Full Stack Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio.

This portfolio is a reflection of my journey as a full stack software developer, showcasing the work I’ve done, the skills I’ve acquired, and the projects I’ve built over the years.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This portfolio exists to:

- Represent me professionally online
- Showcase selected full stack projects (including APIs, systems, real-time apps, etc.)
- Provide potential clients, collaborators, and employers a clear view of my capabilities
- Act as a hub to link my GitHub, blog, and contact information

---

## 🔧 What I'm Building

- **Frontend**: This site is currently deployed as a static frontend using React and Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: I’ll be integrating this with a Django-powered backend to handle blog posts, contact forms, real-time features, and more.
- **Projects**: Each project on this site will be linked to its full GitHub repo with a write-up and live demo (where applicable).
- **Blog**: I plan to add a writing section powered by Markdown or a Django CMS for technical articles and thoughts.

## 📈 Long-Term Vision

- Fully integrated portfolio with dynamic content powered by my own APIs
- Connected dashboard to manage projects, blogs, and traffic insights
- Optional theme customization to keep evolving it over time

## 🤝 Credits

This portfolio is based on the [Full Stack Developer Portfolio Template](https://www.devportfoliotemplates.com/portfolio-templates/full-stack-developer) by [devportfoliotemplates](https://github.com/devportfoliotemplates), which served as a solid foundation for the initial frontend layout.

All customizations, backend work, project integration, and additional features are being built and maintained by me.
